progress-meter
==============

This library can be used to display progress meters or other diagnostics
for concurrently running actions.  It supports dynamic creation and
removal of new sub-meters as well es correct behaviour when printing
diagnostics that are not part of the progress meter and should just
scroll by.

The `System.ProgressMeter` module contains a tutorial.
